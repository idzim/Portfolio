## <a name="about_me">ABOUT ME</a>
I'm working as a Software Tester. I try to automize everywhere where it is possible. I do it mostly to optimize my daily work and develop myself with automation tools. 
Why?
Because:
 - I like do things in a efficient way
 - I love to learn new things
 - I like to put a some effort to minimalize work to do in the future (for myself and other people)
 - I like to finding disfunctional things and bugs

In my work I use: **SQL**, **Playwright**, **Azure DevOps**, **ISTQB**

I also studying Computer Science, where I am learning about diffrent fields of Software Develelopment, how to use programming languages (**C#**, **JavaScript**), working with Databases (**Postgre**, **MySQL**) and also build a website applications using **HTML 5** and **CSS**.

After hours I love coooking, board games and cats.
